# NB: by default, pre-commit only installs the pre-commit hook ("commit" stage),
# but you can tell `pre-commit install` to install other hooks.
# This set of default stages ensures we don't slow down or break other git operations
# even if you install hooks for them.
default_stages:
  - commit
  - merge-commit
  - manual
